# ColorSearch
A program with a GUI that allows you to search for images by color and open them natively in your OS.

<p><b>How to use it</b></p>
<p>1. Pick your color of choice in the window that appears when you first run the program.</p>
  <p>2. Set the threshold (how far in color space this pixel can be from the chosen color) and area (the proportion of pixels in the image that should be within the threshold) and click Ok.</p>
  <p>3. In the next window, choose the directory of images you would like to search.</p>
  <p>4. Press the Search button (or press Cancel to exit). This will result in a view of the directory that includes all the images that fulfill the criteria you set in step 2. Double click a photo or press Open to open the image in your operating system's image viewer.</p>
  <p>5. Press Cancel to repeat steps 3-4 in a different directory. To exit completely, close the window/press Cancel twice.</p>
  
  <p>Note: ColorSearch uses the Euclidean model of color difference.</p>
